# Code of Conduct

Don't be an asshole. That's the code of conduct for this repo. Here are some signs you might be an asshole

* Someone has a legitimate question, and you treat them like an idiot.
* Someone has what you feel like is an illegitimate question, and you treat them like an idiot.
* Someone suggests a different approach, and you treat them like an idiot.
* Someone posts a Pull Request that is good, and you treat them like an idiot.
* Someone posts a Pull Request that isn't very good, and you treat them like an idiot.

I could go on, but if you don't get the point already I'd suggest you probably aren't someone we want contributing to
this repo. If you want to turn it in to your own personal complain/berate fest feel free to not be here.
